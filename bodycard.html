  <p>The Jack Russell Terrier was developed in southern
    England during the mid-1800s by Parson John Russell,
    from whom the breed took its name. Russell aimed to
    create a working terrier who would hunt with hounds,
     bolting foxes from their dens so the hounds could chase them.</p>
